JavaScript with React, HTML with JSX, CSS, uses date-fns

#### Trying Out a New Technology

[QR Code](https://github.com/lydiadunning/qr-code-component-main) - just a static page showing a QR code. The README documents my experience trying Lit.
JavaScript with Lit, HTML and CSS are part of the LitElement class.

[The project’s PR 
history](https://github.com/the-collab-lab/tcl-65-smart-shopping-list/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed) - I contributed code or a code review to each PR.  

[Food Plan](https://github.com/lydiadunning/food-plan/tree/new-model) - a full stack web application.

## My History as a Programmer

#### The Early Years
- First coded in fourth grade, putting everything I had into using a teaching language called LogoWriter to code an animation about idioms.   
- Programmed a TI84 graphing calculator to solve my algebra homework problems.  
- Studied C++ in high school.  
- Studied some CS in college: Java, computer architecture, discrete math, data structures and algorithms.  
- Worked in video game software QA, testing for compliance with specifications.   
- Took a continuing ed. course in UX at the University of Washington. I was really into UX and user centered design for a while.  
#### The Last Few Years
- Reintroduced myself to programming with [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/).  
- Practiced JavaScript basics with [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/). Earned their [DSA certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/fccab6a54da-a98d-459a-833c-19b38579c980/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures).
- Put my skills to use in personal projects (the earliest ones aren’t on GitHub).  
- Took [100 Days of Python](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) on Udemy, which covers many domains within Python development and becomes increasingly hands off, requiring significant research and problem solving.  
- Started [Full Stack open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) for an introduction to React, Node.js, and MongoDB.  
- Built projects from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) to practice React.  
<!--- Sought out a community at 100 Devs, which directed me to resources where I learned about various topics I’d missed, like floats, the JavaScript event loop, and memoization. Joined intending to work in groups and try freelancing, wasn't happy with my progress on those fronts, and decided it wasn't the right fit for me. The community was too big and disorganized for me to get comfortable there, and encouraging participants to call the program an agency rather than a bootcamp is sus.-->
#### Now
- Working through [Full Stack open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/), learning about testing for both express apps and React.  
- Practicing collaboration in [The Collab Lab](https://the-collab-lab.codes/).  After going it alone for so long, I knew I needed a structured environment to get more comfortable working with other developers and to build collaboration skills. Nearing the end of the program, I’ve gotten over most of my discomfort, and I've also made progress in balancing my contributions with a pair partner. I've seen the magic that can happen when successfully collaborating on a problem.
